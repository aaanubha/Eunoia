# Eunoia- A Virtual Study Space

Over the last two years, ongoing lockdowns have taken away not only a student's exposure to the outside world, but also the classroom environment. Users have become extremely unproductive, reluctant, and distracted as a result of this. As a result, we wish to create Eunoia, which will allow users to escape the monotony of their houses by providing a virtually unnoticeable area in which to work, study, research, and so on. With the ongoing pandemic, these people around the world, both students and employees, are confined to their homes. 

The goal is to provide a study atmosphere for individuals who are locked in their rooms with the help of Eunoia, a virtual learning area. In ancient Greek, Eunoia meant "beautiful thinking." The effort is aimed not just at kids in school, but also at teachers, workers, employees, and anybody else who is digitally dependent. Students are facing numerous challenges as a result of the pandemic, including the requirement that many students attend online classes. The virtual study room would stimulate and assist students in choosing a better study space at home, as well as assisting them in concentrating better. The goal is to establish a distraction-free and positive environment for pupils.
